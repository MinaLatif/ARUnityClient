# ARUnityClient
Demonstration on how to use Agora Video SDK in a AR screen sharing scenario. This project amends the Demo project from the Asset Store SDK and the online ARFoundation Tutorial as an advanced tutorial.

#### Dependencies:
- Unity 2019.2 
- Unity Asset [Agora Video SDK](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/video/agora-video-sdk-for-unity-134502)
- Agora AppId [Project page](https://console.agora.io/projects)

#### Project Integration:
1. Clone this project
2. Open the project from Unity 2019.2.  
3. Download and import the Agora Video SDK from Asset Store.  Uncheck "demo" folder when importing to avoid overwriting the new project code.
4. Use Package Manager from Unity Editor to install ARFoundation 3.0.1/ARKit 3.0.1/ARCore 3.0.1.
5. Open TestHome scene and input your AppID to the GameController game object.
6. Following the settings in README_ARFoundation, build and run on compatible iOS and Android devices to test.
